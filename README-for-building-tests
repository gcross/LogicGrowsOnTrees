If you are encountering difficulties building the tests due to multiple
versions of QuickCheck being installed, then read on:

Unfortunately the person responsible for maintaining test-framework-quickcheck2
has failed to keep pace with the latest version of the Haskell Platform, which
results in it requiring QuickCheck 2.5 when everything else uses QuickCheck 2.6.
Thus if you use `cabal install`, you will pull in QuickCheck 2.5 which screws
things up.  The current workaround is to check out my fork, which contains a
patch to bump the version dependency, at

    https://github.com/gcross/test-framework
    
Go to the `quickcheck2` subdirectory and build and install the package there.
